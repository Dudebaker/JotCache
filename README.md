# JotCache

This caching component has a unique selling point compared to all others on the market: you can exclude module positions from caching (e.g. shopping carts)

Since the former developer of this package has abandoned further development and stopped all support a long time ago, I have taken the reins and made the entire package compatible with Joomla 5.

This is just the first step. In terms of design, it is absolutely not yet adapted for Joomla 5, but all the functions should be there.
